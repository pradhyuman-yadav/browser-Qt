# browser-Qt
Simple Web Browser based on QT with Python. URL, Buttons & etc has not been added.
Audio & Video access has been given with disallowing every other permission.
Tried to create a lite version of web applications such as Discord/Teams/etc but it takes pretty similar amount of memory to that of Microsoft Edge & Firefox.
